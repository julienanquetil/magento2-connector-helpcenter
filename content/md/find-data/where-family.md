# Where to find my PIM families in SFCC?


**Since the concept of "family" (attribute set) does not exist in SFCC, the Akeneo connector will not import the PIM families.**

Whatever the family they belong to, all attributes will be exported to each product in Salesforce Commerce Cloud.
Attributes values will also be fetched according to what has been filled in the PIM.
